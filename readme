Here are the explanation of the program which I made. How it works.

I make the program using JAVA and tool that I used is Eclipse

The csv reader read the file and I stored in hashmap like way:

the content of the file like:
1, 4.00, teddy_bear
1, 8.00, baby_powder
2, 5.00, teddy_bear
2, 6.50, baby_powder
3, 4.00, pampers_diapers
3, 8.00, johnson_wipes
4, 5.00, johnson_wipes
4, 2.50, cotton_buds
5, 4.00, bath_towel
5, 8.00, scissor
6, 5.00, scissor
6, 6.00, bath_towel, cotton_balls, powder_puff


So at the scanning time I made 2 hashmap price and product_map.
the price hashmap contain the price, product vise means
(key,value)=(1,12)
(key,value)=(2,11.5)
(key,value)=(3,12)
(key,value)=(4,7)

like wise..

and the 2nd hashmap product_map have
(key,value)=(1,teddy_bear,baby_powder)
(key,value)=(2,teddy_powder,baby_powder)

like wise upto total product.

After that I create final hashmap means mapping of all 3 using above 2 hashmap and that hashmap(temp) contain value like this:

(key,value)=(1,teddy_bear,baby_powder 12)
(key,value)=(2,teddy_powder,baby_powder 11.5)

like wise
After the scanning now we find the minimum cost and product id. for that 
customer product that are looking for store in userProduct (teddy_bear,baby_powder) after that it will search in temp hashmap.
and store the cost value and compare with min_cost if it's less then then we can update our min_cost and update our product id.
